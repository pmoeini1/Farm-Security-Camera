# Farm-Security-Camera
Made a security camera software that uses AI to detect intruders and alert farmer.
Created in a few hours for Studenthacks 2021 hackathon.
Our solution to minimize losses for poultry farmers is an AI security camera. The camera recognizes if an individual or a predator is in the chicken coop using OpenCV software, and runs a Python script to notify the farmer via email. The Tweepy API is used to maintain an automated Twitter account sharing photos of anyone who intrudes into the chicken coop.
